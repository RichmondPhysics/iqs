\textbf{Objectives }

\begin{itemize}
\item To learn how to use a force probe to measure force. 
\item To understand the relationship between forces applied to an object and its motions. 
\item To find mathematical relationships among the force applied to an object, its acceleration, and the directions of the force and acceleration.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Overview }

In the previous labs, you have used a motion detector to display position-time,
velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs of the motion of different objects.
You were not concerned about how you got the objects to move, i.e., what forces
(pushes or pulls) acted on the objects. From your experiences, you know that
force and motion are related in some way. To start your bicycle moving, you
must apply a force to the pedal. To start up your car, you must step on the
gas pedal to get the engine to apply a force to the road through the tires.

But, exactly how is force related to the quantities you used in the previous
unit to describe motion --- position, velocity and acceleration? In this unit you
will pay attention to forces and how they affect motion. You will apply forces
to a cart, and observe the nature of its resulting motion graphically with a
motion detector.


\textbf{Apparatus} 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Science Workshop 750 Interface}
\item Force probe 
\item Variety of hanging masses 
\item Low friction pulley and string 
\item Motion detector 
\item Dynamics cart (with flag) and track 
\item \textit{DataStudio} software (V, A \& F Graphs application)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Measuring Forces} 

In this investigation you will use a force probe (also called a force sensor) to measure forces. 
The force probe puts out a voltage signal proportional to the force applied to the arm of the probe. 
Physicists have defined a standard unit of force called the newton, abbreviated N. 
For your work on forces and the motions they cause, it will be more convenient to have the force probe read directly in newtons rather than voltage
so the force probe must be calibrated. 
To calibrate the force probe, see \textit{Calibrating Force Sensors} in \textbf{Appendix E: Instrumentation}.

\textbf{Motion and Force} 

Now you can use the force probe to apply measured amounts of force to an object.
You can also use the motion detector, as in the previous units, to examine the
motion of the object. In this way you will be able to establish the relationship
between motion and force.
\vspace{10mm}

\newpage

\textbf{Activity \stepcounter{activity}\arabic{activity}: Pushing and Pulling a Cart} 

In this activity you will move a cart by pushing and pulling it with your hand.
You will measure the force, velocity and acceleration. Then you will be able
to look for relationships between the applied force and the motion quantities.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Calibrate the force probe if you haven't already done so (see \textit{Calibrating Force Sensors} in \textbf{Appendix E: Instrumentation}). 
Then set up the cart, force probe and motion detector on the level track as shown in Figure \ref{forcefig1}. 
Measure and record the mass of the cart and force probe assembly (using the compact scale).

\begin{center}
{\includegraphics{iqsForce/force1_fig1b.eps}}
\caption{Equipment setup for qualitative measurements of force and motion.}\label{forcefig1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\item Suppose you grasp the hook on the force probe and move the cart forwards
and backwards in front of the motion detector. Do you think that either the
velocity or the acceleration graph will look like the force graph? Is either
of these motion quantities related to force? That is to say, if you apply a
changing force to the cart, will the velocity or acceleration change in the
same way as the force?
\vspace{30mm}

\item To test your predictions, open the V, A \& F Graphs application. Grasp the
hook on the force probe and start acquiring data. When you hear the clicks,
pull the cart away from the motion detector, and quickly stop it. Then push
it back towards the motion detector, and again quickly stop it. Be sure that
the cart never gets closer than 0.15 m away from the detector and be careful
of the wires. Repeat until you get a good run, and adjust 
the scale of the axes if necessary. Sketch your graphs on the axes below.

\end{center}
\end{figure}
\vspace{0.3cm}

\item Does either graph--velocity or acceleration--resemble the force graph? Which
one? Explain.
\vspace{20mm}

\item Based on your observations, does it appear that either the velocity or acceleration
of the cart might be related to the applied force? Explain.
\vspace{20mm}

\end{enumerate}

%\newpage

\textbf{Activity \stepcounter{activity}\arabic{activity}: Finding the Relationship Between Acceleration and Force}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the {\it SmartTool} in {\it DataStudio} (see {\bf Appendix B: Introduction to DataStudio}) to record six
sets of acceleration ($a$) and force ($F$) values and enter them in the table below.

\begin{center}
\begin{table}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
   & $\qquad a(m/s^2)\qquad$ &\qquad $F(N)$\qquad \\ \hline

2  &                         &                    \\ \hline

4  &                         &                    \\ \hline
5  &                         &                    \\ \hline
6  &                         &                    \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Measured values of force and acceleration.}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\end{center}

\newpage

\item Make a plot of force versus acceleration with properly labeled axes with units.
Attach it to this unit.
Are force and acceleration proportional to each other? Why or why not?

\vspace{10mm}

\item If force is proportional to acceleration, then what is the value of the constant of proportionality (Hint: fit your data)?
What are its units? 

\vspace{10mm}

\item What is the equation that relates the force and the acceleration, 

\vspace{10mm}

\item How does the mass of your cart compare with the constant of 
proportionality between force and acceleration?
What does this say about the meaning of the constant of proportionality? About the meaning of mass?

\vspace{10mm}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Speeding Up and Slowing Down }

So far you have looked at cases where the velocity, force and acceleration all
have the same sign (all positive). That is, the vectors representing each of
these three vector quantities all point in the same direction. For example,
if the cart is moving toward the right and a force is exerted toward the right,
then the cart will speed up. Thus the acceleration is also toward the right.
The three vectors can be represented as:

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{iqsForce/force2_fig1.eps}
\caption{Representation of motion/kinematics vectors} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

If the positive x direction is toward the right, then you could also say that
the velocity, acceleration and also force are all positive. In this investigation,
you will examine the vectors representing velocity, force and acceleration for
other motions of the cart. This will be an extension of your earlier observations
of changing motion.

\textbf{Activity \stepcounter{activity}\arabic{activity}: Slowing Down} 

Set up the cart, pulley, hanging mass and motion detector as shown in Figure \ref{forcefig3}. Now
when you give the cart a push away from the motion detector, it will slow down
after it is released. In this activity you will examine the acceleration and
the applied force.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
{\includegraphics{iqsForce/force2_fig2.eps}}
\caption{Setup for applying constant force.}\label{forcefig3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose that you position the cart 0.15 m from the motion detector and give
it a push away from the motion detector and release it. Draw below vectors which
might represent the velocity, force and acceleration of the cart at each time
after it is released and is moving toward the right. Be sure to mark your arrows
with \( {\bf v} \), \( {\bf a} \), or \( {\bf F} \)
as appropriate.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item If the positive x direction is toward the right, what are the signs of the
velocity, force and acceleration after the cart is released and is moving toward
the right?
\vspace{10mm}

\item To test your predictions: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Calibrate the force probe (see \textit{Calibrating Force Sensors} in \textbf{Appendix E: Instrumentation}).
\item Hang a 50-g mass from the end of the string.
\item Use the V, A \& F Graphs application to graph the motion. 
\item Test to be sure that the motion detector sees the cart during its complete motion,
and that the string and force probe cable are not interfering with the motion
detector. You may need to move the motion detector to the side slightly so that
it does not see the string. Also make sure that the cables to the motion detector
do not impede the motion of the cart. Remember that the back of the cart must
always be at least 0.15 meter from the motion detector. 
\item Start recording data. When the motion detector starts clicking, give the cart
a short push away from the motion detector and then let it go. Stop the cart
before it reverses its direction. Repeat until you get a good run. 
\item Sketch your velocity, acceleration and force graphs on the axes below. Label
the time scale on these axes. Indicate with an arrow the time when the push
stopped.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{iqsForce/force2_fig4.eps}
\caption{Velocity, acceleration, and force versus time plots.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item Did the signs of the velocity, force and acceleration agree with your predictions?
If not, can you now explain the signs?
\vspace{15mm}

\item Did the velocity and acceleration both have the same sign? Explain these
signs based on the relationship between acceleration and velocity.
\vspace{20mm}

\item Did the force and acceleration have the same sign? Were the force and acceleration
in the same direction? Explain.
\vspace{20mm}

\item Based on your observations, draw below vectors which might represent the
velocity, force and acceleration for the cart at the same instant in time. Do
these agree with your predictions? If not, can you now explain the directions
of the vectors?
\vspace{20mm}

\item After you released the cart, was the force applied by the falling mass constant,
increasing or decreasing? Explain why this kind of force is necessary to cause
the observed motion of the cart.
\vspace{20mm}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{comment}

\textbf{Activity \stepcounter{activity}\arabic{activity}: Speeding Up Toward the Motion Detector }

Using the same setup as in the last activity, you can start with the cart at
the opposite end of the table from the motion detector and release it from rest.
It will then be accelerated toward the motion detector as a result of the force
applied by the falling mass.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose that you release the cart from rest and let it move toward the motion
detector. Draw on the diagram below vectors which might represent the velocity,
force and acceleration of the cart at each time after it is released and is
moving toward the left. Be sure to mark your arrows with \textbf{v}, \textbf{a},
or \textbf{F} as appropriate.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{center}
{\includegraphics{iqsForce/force2_fig5.eps}}
\caption{Stroboscopic snapshot of moving cart.}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\item What are the signs of the velocity, force and acceleration after the cart
is released and is moving toward the motion detector? (The positive x direction
is toward the right.)
\vspace{20mm}

\item Test your predictions. Use a hanging mass of 100 g. Start recording data.
When you hear the motion detector, release the cart from rest as far away from
the motion detector as possible. Catch the cart before it hits the motion detector.
Repeat until you get a good run. Sketch your graphs on the above axes with dashed
lines.

\item Which of the signs -- velocity, force and/or acceleration -- are the same as
in the previous activity (where the cart was slowing down and moving away), and
which are different? Explain any differences in terms of the differences in
the motion of the cart.
\vspace{20mm}

\item Based on your observations, draw below vectors which might represent the
velocity, force and acceleration for the cart at the same instant in time. Do
these agree with your predictions? If not, can you now explain the directions
of the vectors?
\vspace{30mm}

\item Write down a simple rule in words which describes the relationship between
the direction of the applied force and the direction of the acceleration for
any motion of the cart.
\vspace{20mm}

\item Is the direction of the velocity always the same as the direction of the
force? Is the direction of the acceleration always the same as the direction
of the force? In terms of its magnitude and direction, what is the effect of
a force on the motion of an object?
\vspace{20mm}

\item What is the equation relating force to acceleration in full vector notation?
